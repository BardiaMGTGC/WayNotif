# WayNotif
My notification script for Waydroid (designed for UT but will probably work with other platforms aswell with little modification)
To install WayNotif run the following command:

bash <(wget -qO - https://bardia.tech/waynotif-install)

You can use this command to also install htop, bashtop, ncdu and a direct libertine shell icon to the appdrawer
